#### Overiew
- `Express` in -> JS
- `FastAPI` in -> Python
- Both gives same developer experience.
- Django is a good framework, 
	- but for pure API development, it is not an option. Instead, `REST API` is used as a hacky solution.
	- But not performace optimize.

<br>


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In `JS express` gives same developer experience for fastly build API.
> - Under in `Python Fast API` gives same experience as JS express give.
> - Not only experience but, its `one of the industry standard`.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> - Any can work as Data Scientist or Python based web developement journey knowing of Fast API working is most important thing.
> - ALl industry are migrate in that or machine based consumption mostly in that Fast API.

### Fast API with doc
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
[Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)

- Fast API work with some helper :-
- 1] Most used of `Uvicorn` --> its basic `web server` (pure web server implementation).
	- Also directly run through FastAPI but, mostly coder run `Uvicorn` web server.
- 2] For any python web application devlopement one standard is all companies are use i.e. `Pydantic`
	- Pydantic is `data validation library` for python.
	- In python `data types are not defined` i.e that help through 'Py'.
